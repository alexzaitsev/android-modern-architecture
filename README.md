[![cover](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2372414/233195750-2a00152d-7a69-4ada-9dbc-646464f63a8b.png)](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-android-architecture/?referralCode=AA60BFC9B867AD172067)

This course is designed for **all levels of Middle/Senior Android developers** who wish to advance their knowledge on how to create cutting-edge, scalable, and maintainable Android applications.

Throughout the course, you will learn how to **apply the Clean Architecture** approach to your app development process, to create a codebase that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend. You will also learn how to **leverage the Android Compose** framework to **build user interfaces that are reactive, declarative, and easy to test.**

You will discover the ideas and abilities required to master Modern Android Jetpack Compose-based Clean Architecture in this course, which is organized into a series of lectures and practical activities.

**More precisely, you'll learn how to:**
1. Learn how to create contemporary Android applications that are scalable and maintainable utilizing the newest tools and technologies.
2. Apply the Layered Clean Architecture approach to your app development process.
3. Start creating codebases that are simple to comprehend, extend, and maintain.
4. Understand how the codebase is evolving over time and what critical points you should pay attention to.
5. Learn how to use the Jetpack Compose framework to build user interfaces that are reactive, declarative, and easy to test.
6. Use reactive programming techniques to create responsive and scalable apps.
7. Benefit of using MVI presentational pattern for easier codebase on a view layer.
8. Understand how to test and debug Modern Android Architecture.

By the end of this course, you **will master the art of architecture extension** (scalability). That means that **you'll be able to start with a modest codebase** that, if necessary, **may be quickly developed into a large application.**

You will have the skills required to **launch a new project** or **convert an outdated codebase** into **a professional, modern, scalable, and well-maintained Android application**. You will be able to **reliably provide top-notch apps** to your users by applying the Layered Architecture principles, Jetpack Compose framework, and MVI presentational pattern to your projects.

I'll walk you through starting with a small codebase, explaining when it has to be extended, and exactly how to do it, starting with the architectural approach and tools and concluding with the structure of the code and files.

**The course consists of:**
- 19 lectures (+1 bonus!)
- 100 minutes of the high-quality video content
- 4 quizzes
- 2 gists
- 1 complete test project that will be developed through the course (available on Github!)
- A LOT of insights! I promise!

**All the materials leave with you forever**, so you always can use code samples and test project supplied in this course as a guide for your development.

## Dev notes
### To enable Detekt pre-commit hook
Run `cp detekt/pre-commit .git/hooks`. That's it.
